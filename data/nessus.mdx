## Troubleshooting this bastard

### 1. Crash during installation : missing plugins

I found in the logs that "[Wed Aug 16 22:49:00 2023][11442.1] Your installation is missing plugins. Please register and try again"

* Logs at /opt/nessus/var/nessus/logs/

* Register Nessus:

```sh
sudo /opt/nessus/sbin/nessuscli fetch --register <activation_code>
```

* Update Nessus Plugins:

```sh
sudo /opt/nessus/sbin/nessuscli update
```

* Start Nessus Service:

```sh
sudo service nessusd start
```
