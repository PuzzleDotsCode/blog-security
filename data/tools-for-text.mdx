# Tools for Text

## grep

In a nutshell, grep1 searches text files for the occurrence of a given regular expression and outputs any line containing a match to the standard output, which is usually the terminal screen. Some of the most commonly used switches include -r for recursive searching and -i to ignore text case. Consider the following example:

```bash
kali@kali:~$ ls -la /usr/bin | grep zip
-rwxr-xr-x  3 root root   34480 Jan 29  2017 bunzip2
-rwxr-xr-x  3 root root   34480 Jan 29  2017 bzip2
-rwxr-xr-x  1 root root   13864 Jan 29  2017 bzip2recover
-rwxr-xr-x  2 root root    2301 Mar 14  2016 gunzip
-rwxr-xr-x  1 root root  105172 Mar 14  2016 gzip
```

Here's listed all the files in the /usr/bin directory with ls and pipe the output into the grep command, which searches for any line containing the string "zip". Understanding the grep tool and when to use it can prove incredibly useful.

## sed

sed is a powerful stream editor. It is also very complex so we will only briefly scratch its surface here. At a very high level, sed performs text editing on a stream of text, either a set of specific files or standard output. Let's look at an example:

```bash
kali@kali:~$ echo "I need to try hard" | sed 's/hard/harder/'
I need to try harder
```

Here's created a stream of text using the echo command and then piped it to sed in order to replace the word "hard" with "harder". Note that by default the output has been automatically redirected to the standard output.

## cut

The cut command is simple, but often comes in quite handy. It is used to extract a section of text from a line and output it to the standard output. Some of the most commonly-used switches include -f for the field number we are cutting and -d for the field delimiter.

```bash
kali@kali:~$ echo "I hack binaries,web apps,mobile apps, and just about anything else"| cut -f 2 -d ","
web apps
```

Here's echoed a line of text and piped it to the cut command to extract the second field using a comma (,) as the field delimiter. The same command can be used with lines in text files as shown below, where a list of users is extracted from /etc/passwd by using : as a delimiter and retrieving the first field:

```bash
kali@kali:~$ cut -d ":" -f 1 /etc/passwd
root
daemon
bin
sys
sync
games
...
```

## awk

AWK is a programming language designed for text processing and is typically used as a data extraction and reporting tool. It is also extremely powerful and can be quite complex, so we will only scratch the surface here. A commonly used switch with awk is -F, which is the field separator, and the print command, which outputs the result text.

```bash
kali@kali:~$ echo "hello::there::friend" | awk -F "::" '{print $1, $3}'
hello friend
```

Here's echoed a line and piped it to awk to extract the first ($1) and third ($3) fields using :: as a field separator. The most prominent difference between the cut and awk examples we used is that cut can only accept a single character as a field delimiter, while awk, as shown in Listing 20, is much more flexible. As a general rule of thumb, when you start having a command involving multiple cut operations, you may want to consider switching to awk.

## comm

The `comm` command compares two text files, displaying the lines that are unique to each one, as well as the lines they have in common. 

It outputs three space-offset columns: 

1. the first contains lines that are **unique to first file** or argument; 
2. the second contains lines that are **unique to second file** or argument; and 
3. the third column contains lines that are **shared by both files**. 

The `-[n]` switch, where "n" is either 1, 2, or 3, can be used to suppress one or more columns, depending on the need. e.g `comm -12 [file-a] [file-b]` displayed only the lines that were found in both files since we suppressed the first and second columns as `-12`.


---


## diff

The `diff` command detects differences between files and supports many output formats. Most popular formats: 

* context format (-c)
* unified format (-u)

The output uses the "-" indicator to show that the line appears in the first file, but not in the second. Conversely, the "+" indicator shows that the line appears in the second file, but not in the first.

The most notable difference between these formats is that the unified format does not show lines that match between files, making the results shorter. The indicators have identical meaning in both formats.

## vimdiff

Opens vim with multiple files, one in each window. The differences between files are highlighted, which makes it easier to visually inspect them. 

Few Shortcuts:

`do`: gets changes from the other window into the current one
`dp`: puts the changes from the current window into the other one
`]c`: jumps to the next change
`[c`: jumps to the previous change
`Ctrl + w`: switches to the other split window.

# Examples

Use Bash commands to inspect the evidence of an attack: an Apache HTTP server log. 

1. Use `head` and `wc` to identify patterns/delimiters in the data

```
kali@kali:~$ head access.log
201.21.152.44 - - [25/Apr/2013:14:05:35 -0700] "GET /favicon.ico HTTP/1.1" 404 89 "-" "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.2; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.31 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/26.0.1410.64 Safari/537.31" "random-site.com"
70.194.129.34 - - [25/Apr/2013:14:10:48 -0700] "GET /include/jquery.jshowoff.min.js HTTP/1.1" 200 2553 "http://www.random-site.com/" "Mozilla/5.0 (Linux; U; Android 4.1.2; en-us; SCH-I535 Build/JZO54K) AppleWebKit/534.30 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/4.0 Mobile Safari/534.30" "www.random-site.com"

kali@kali:~$ wc -l access.log
1173 access.log
```

2. Use `cut` to extract data based in target fields

```
kali@kali:~$ cat access.log | cut -d " " -f 1 | sort -u
201.21.152.44
208.115.113.91
208.54.80.244
208.68.234.99
70.194.129.34
72.133.47.242
88.112.192.2
98.238.13.253
99.127.177.95
...
```

3. count access by ip occurrences

```
kali@kali:~$ cat access.log | cut -d " " -f 1 | sort | uniq -c | sort -urn
   1038 208.68.234.99
     59 208.115.113.91
     22 208.54.80.244
     21 99.127.177.95
      8 70.194.129.34
      1 201.21.152.44
```
