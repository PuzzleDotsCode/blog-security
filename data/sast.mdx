# Static Application Security Testing

SAST Tools analyze the source code or compiled versions of code 
to find security flaws. Identifies certain well-known vulnerabilities, 
as Buffer overflows, SQL injection, etc. The output highlight the problematic code, by filename, location, 
line number, and even the affected code snippet.

I tried 10 SAST tools with the purpose to do a simple analysis of an webapp code, 
finally I found that in my case Snyk and Samgrep was the most simple and fast to use. 
The code analysis is not so robust as the dependency analysis but it's very useful.
Both runs the code analysis through the CLI from inside the project folder.

* semgrep scan --config auto
* snyk code test

After all, Snyk and Samgrep are easy to download, install and use. Both do dependency analysis and static code analysis. Both has an easy to use CLI. Recommended to start.
