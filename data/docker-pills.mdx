# Docker Pills

#### General Ops

```
# active containers
docker ps -a

# active images
docker images -a

# remove containers
docker stop $(docker ps -aq) && docker rm (docker ps -aq)

# remove images
docker rmi $(docker images -aq)

# remove images, containers & volumes from docker system
docker systen prune -a

# start (build creates a new container)
docker start [container-name]

# stop
docker stop [container-name]
```

## Commit Changes

If the image is already linked to the remote repo by a tag, then just "tag" the local image is enough because the "push" is automatic.

```
# already linked
docker tag [local-image-name] [username]/[repo-name]
```

If the image is not linked to the remote repo by a tag, firstly bind the container with the repo by a tag. Then, It's ready to push.

```
# not linked
docker commit [CONTAINER_ID] [image_name]
docker push [username]/[repo-name]
```

## Login

```
docker login -u [username] -p [password]
```

# Process

To Dockerize an app, create the image, run the container.

1. create the Dockerfile

```
# Support System
FROM node:17-alpine

# Work Dir
WORKDIR /client

# Image Actions
COPY . /client

# Buildtime Command Executions
RUN npm install

# Container Ports Exposure
EXPOSE 3000

# Runtime Command Execution
CMD ["npm","run","dev"]
```

2. build the image, optionally give it a tag

```
docker build [-t tag_name] .    
```

3. run the image, ports, (optionally by tag) in current location

```
docker run -p [port]:[port] [tag]
```

4. aws tag

```
docker tag [local-image]:[tag (both should mathc)] [aws-resource-location]:[tag (both should mathc)]
```

## Caching Node Modules

Caching Node Modules avoid the re-installation of them each time the image is built. Only if the `package.json` file.

```
# Support System
FROM node:17-alpine

# Work Dir
WORKDIR /client

# Image Actions
COPY package.json /client

# Buildtime Command Executions
RUN npm install

# Image Actions
COPY . /client
```

## Update AWS ECS

```
aws ecs update-service --cluster [cluster-name] --service [service-name] --force-new-deployment --region [region]
```
