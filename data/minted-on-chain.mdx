# What means "This badge has not been minted on-chain yet." and how to solve it?

The message "This badge has not been minted on-chain yet" typically means that the Non-Fungible Token (NFT) representing the badge has not been created on the blockchain. In the context of your question, it seems like the badge is a form of credential or achievement in a learning platform, which is represented as an NFT.

To solve this issue, the badge needs to be minted on the blockchain. Minting is the process of creating a new token (in this case, an NFT) on the blockchain. This process is usually done by calling a function in a smart contract that has been deployed on the blockchain.

Here's a simplified example of how you might mint an NFT in Solidity, which is a popular language for writing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.5.0;

import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC721/ERC721Full.sol";
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/drafts/Counters.sol";

contract BadgeMinter is ERC721Full {
    using Counters for Counters.Counter;
    Counters.Counter private _tokenIds;

    constructor() ERC721Full("Badge", "BDG") public {
    }

    function mintBadge(address recipient, string memory tokenURI) public returns (uint256) {
        _tokenIds.increment();

        uint256 newItemId = _tokenIds.current();
        _mint(recipient, newItemId);
        _setTokenURI(newItemId, tokenURI);

        return newItemId;
    }
}
```

In this example, the mintBadge function creates a new NFT and assigns it to the recipient. The tokenURI parameter is a string that points to a JSON file with the NFT's metadata.

Remember, this is a simplified example. In a real-world application, you would need to include access controls to ensure that only authorized accounts can mint new badges.
