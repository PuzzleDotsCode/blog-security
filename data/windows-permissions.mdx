# Windows Permissions

```sh
# check permissions
icacls [file]

# read content

The `<perm>` option is a permission mask that can be specified in one of the following forms:

A sequence of simple rights (basic permissions):

F - Full access

M- Modify access

RX - Read and execute access

R - Read-only access

W - Write-only access

A comma-separated list in parenthesis of specific rights (advanced permissions):

D - Delete

RC - Read control (read permissions)

WDAC - Write DAC (change permissions)

WO - Write owner (take ownership)

S - Synchronize

AS - Access system security

MA - Maximum allowed

GR - Generic read

GW - Generic write

GE - Generic execute

GA - Generic all

RD - Read data/list directory

WD - Write data/add file

AD - Append data/add subdirectory

REA - Read extended attributes

WEA - Write extended attributes

X - Execute/traverse

DC - Delete child

RA - Read attributes

WA - Write attributes

Inheritance rights may precede either `<perm>` form:

(I) - Inherit. ACE inherited from the parent container.

(OI) - Object inherit. Objects in this container will inherit this ACE. Applies only to directories.

(CI) - Container inherit. Containers in this parent container will inherit this ACE. Applies only to directories.

(IO) - Inherit only. ACE inherited from the parent container, but does not apply to the object itself. Applies only to directories.

(NP) - Do not propagate inherit. ACE inherited by containers and objects from the parent container, but does not propagate to nested containers. Applies only to directories.
