# Characteristics of Subdomains

Sometimes subdomains could be located in a different ip address 
from the domain or as a virtual host.

In this case, the target subdomain is two letters long, then crunch creates a wordlist 
two characters long with all possible combinations.

```
crunch 2 2 > 2-letters-wordlist.txt
```
